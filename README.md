Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Version control is a system that allows developers to track and manage changes made to software code over time.
1.Repository- is a place where the project's files and history are stored.It contains the full history of all changes made to the project.
2.Commit- a commit is a snapshot of changes made to files in the repository at a particular point in time.
3.Branvh- a branch is a separate line of development. When you create a branch, you dierge from the main codebase allowing you to amke changes without affecting the main ersion of the project.
4. Merge- when changes in a branch are ready they are merged back into the main branch.
5.Conflict- A conflict occurs when two different changes are made to the same part of the code at the same time in different branches.VS tools helps identify and resolve these conflicts before merging.
6.Tag- tags are used to mark specific points in the commit history, such as releases or milestones, for easy reference.
7.Remote repositories- a remote repository is a version controlled repository hosted on a server.It allows multiple collaborators to access and contribute to the same project.
why popular?
1.It is powered by git which is fast, reliable and powerful vcs.
2.Easy collaborations with other developers.
3.Forking and cloning- easy forking and cloning of repositories whic crreates a copy of a repository under their own github account
4.Documentation and wiki- Github offers built in upport for documentation using markdown files and even provides a wiki for projects, making it easier to maintain documentaion within the same platform.
5.Visibility ad management-  github provides an interface to view commit history track bugs manage issues and set up project boards all of which contribute to eficient proect management.
How does vc help in maintaining project integrity?
1.Tracking changes
2.Collaborating without overwriting
3.Reverting changes
4.Conflict resolution
